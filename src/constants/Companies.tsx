The Blankspace teams were 100% available, flexible and welcoming, both during the production of our event and on the big day. Whether it's a one-day meeting or a walking dinner for 60 people, we warmly recommend Blankspace for its modernity, flexibility and teams who care about your needs.

The food was really good, and all my concerns around vegan / vegetarian Asian cusine were taken cared of. Please, pass many compliments to the caterer – many of my collegues approached me to praise the food. Once again, thanks for organizing a lovely evening. ",

			" We had 2 events at blankspace during an autumn of 2023. Our first event was for our US & France teams and we had 35 participants. Second event was just before Christmas holidays with 55 members of our team and partners. I can say that from the very start to an end blankspace’s team performed very well, the place is exceptionally well designed and all minor details have been thought of. We had catering from Fonteyne the Kitchen which we loved and service was amazing as well! We thank blankspace team and will be definitely back with more events in 2024 & 2025!",

			"Blankspace brussel m’a permis d’organiser mes fiançailles dans de très bonnes conditions. Ils ont été très attentifs à nos besoins et ont réagis directement. Tout le personnel a été très accueillant et super sympa. Ils ont diffusé nos photos dans des écrans télés de sorte à ce que les invités puissent les voir et les invités on beaucoup aimés cela. La salle était lumineuse et bien équipée (cuisine, sono, toilette, ..). Tout était magnifique !",

			"Our overall experience at Blankspace was fantastic. The party was a huge success, and both the children and adults had a wonderful time. The venue provided a perfect atmosphere for our event, and everything exceeded our expectations. The level of service and support provided by the Blankspace team throughout the planning and execution of our event was exceptional. Jamil, the owner, was incredibly helpful and accommodating. His availability prior to the event was invaluable as he assisted us in sorting out all the details. Jamil's warm and welcoming demeanor, along with his flexibility, made the entire process smooth and enjoyable. We truly appreciated his assistance, and it greatly contributed to the success of our party. Based on our experience, we wholeheartedly recommend Blankspace to others for similar events. The venue offers everything you could need for a memorable celebration, and Jamil's dedication to ensuring everything runs smoothly is commendable. We would definitely consider returning to Blankspace for future events, as it provided the perfect setting for our son's party, and we are confident it would do the same for any other occasion.",

			"Our experience at Blankspace was fantastic. The welcoming atmosphere, along with space tailored to our needs, set the perfect stage for our event. The live broadcast of the sushi preparation on screens was a thoughtful solution, making the experience both enjoyable and convenient for all 40 participants. The overall event not only connected people but also provided a fun learning experience, complemented by delicious food. The service at Blankspace was welcoming and flexible, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere. The team's proactive thinking and creative solutions, especially the live sushi preparation broadcast, stood out. Their attention to detail and adaptability ensured a seamless experience. Blankspace's commitment to making our event enjoyable and memorable was evident in every aspect. We wholeheartedly recommend Blankspace to others for similar events. The simplicity and cleanliness of the space, coupled with the warmth and coziness emanating from the service and Blankspace team, make it an ideal choice. We've had team meetings and gatherings here, and each time, Blankspace provided the perfect balance of the working area and a welcoming environment for our team to connect. Looking forward to considering Blankspace for future events.",

			"Blankspace is a perfect spot to have a meeting with your team in a new vibrant environment. The space is cozy and clean and has a warm atmosphere thanks to the wooden details. The coffee corner is perfect to take a short break. There is only one coffee machine, so if the whole team needs to fuel up, you may want to foresee some extra time. The lunch was amazing with several tasty, healthy and vegan options. The portions were a little bit too big, but the staff offered to the team to take the rest home in doggy bags, which was highly appreciated. The venue can be a bit cold during wintertime, so make sure you put on the heathers in time. The team is super helpful during the planning process of your event and they are reachable and nearby during your event, but at the same time ‘invisible’ – the perfect balance. Our team was so happy with the overall experience, that we decided to book our summer event at Blankspace too!.",
